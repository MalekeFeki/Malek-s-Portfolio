        <p>
            In today’s fast-paced tech environment, delivering value quickly and efficiently is essential. That’s why many software development teams adopt the <strong>Scrum framework</strong> — an agile methodology designed to manage complex projects while encouraging collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement.
        </p>

        <h3>📌 What is Scrum?</h3>
        <p>
            Scrum is an <strong>agile project management framework</strong> that helps teams deliver high-quality software incrementally. Unlike traditional “waterfall” methods, Scrum embraces change and empowers teams to adapt quickly through short development cycles called <strong>sprints</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>👥 Scrum Roles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: Defines the product vision and prioritizes the backlog</li>
            <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Facilitates Scrum practices and removes blockers for the team</li>
            <li><strong>Development Team</strong>: Delivers the product increment during each sprint</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📅 Scrum Events</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sprint Planning</strong>: Define what to deliver in the upcoming sprint</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Stand-up</strong>: Quick team sync to track progress and blockers</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Review</strong>: Demo the increment to stakeholders</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong>: Reflect and improve the team’s process</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🧰 Scrum Artifacts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Backlog</strong>: All desired features and tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>: Tasks chosen for the current sprint</li>
            <li><strong>Increment</strong>: The working product delivered at the end of a sprint</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🚀 Benefits of Scrum</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Faster delivery of value</li>
            <li>Better collaboration and communication</li>
            <li>Transparency and continuous feedback</li>
            <li>Early detection of problems</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🧪 Scrum in Action</h3>
        <p>
            A typical Scrum team works in 2-week sprints. They manage tasks using tools like <strong>Jira</strong>, <strong>Trello</strong>, or <strong>Confluence</strong>. Daily stand-ups keep everyone aligned and help spot obstacles early. At the end of each sprint, the team reviews progress and adapts for the next iteration.
        </p>

        <h3>📚 Getting Started with Scrum</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the official Scrum Guide (scrumguides.org)</li>
            <li>Take a Scrum certification (like the Scrum Foundation from CertiProf)</li>
            <li>Use tools like Jira or Trello to apply it in practice</li>
        </ul>
